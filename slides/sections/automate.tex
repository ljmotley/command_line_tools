    When you are writing code for a project, ideally everything that goes into
    the final product should be able to be run with one process.

    There are a variety of ways to implement this; the most basic is
    a \texttt{run\_all} script in your language of choice.

    But there are more versatile, language-agnostic tools such as Makefiles and
    Taskfiles if you want to explore these options.
